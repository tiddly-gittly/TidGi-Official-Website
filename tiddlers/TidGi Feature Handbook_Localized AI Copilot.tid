Local AI configuration tutorial:

# At least [[v0.8.1-prerelease6|https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/TidGi-Desktop/releases]] or higher version of TidGi.
## Install and open TidGi, open [[TidGi Settings]], find [[Language Model Settings]], click the "Open Model Folder" button to open the model folder.
## Note that the folder name is `language-model`.
# Download the `ggml-vic7b-q5_1.bin` AI model File on [[huggingface/vicuna/ggml-vicuna-7b-1.1|https://huggingface.co/vicuna/ggml-vicuna-7b-1.1/tree/main]].
## Rename the downloaded `ggml-vic7b-q5_1.bin` model file to `llama.bin` (or change the name of the model file to be loaded in [[Language Model Settings]], default is `llama.bin`)
## You can also choose to download the smaller but dumber `ggml-vic7b-q4_0.bin` model, or the bigger, smarter and slower model on [[ggml-vicuna-13b-1.1|https://huggingface.co/vicuna/ggml-vicuna-13b-1.1]].
## Some experts also recommend downloading models with `uncensored` in their names, because [[unaligned, but better performance|https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models]]
# Put `llama.bin` into the model folder `language-model` that you just opened by clicking the button.
# You're ready to go!

Using the tutorial:

# Make sure you have the ''latest'' `linonetwo/tidgi-language-model` plugin installed.
## There will be a `TG AI` tab in the sidebar.
## The new version of TidGi comes with this plugin pre-installed in the new workspace.
# Open the "TG AI" tab in the sidebar in the Wiki.
# Ask the AI simple questions like `What is Tiddlywiki?`
# Wait for the AI to calculate the results
## Since the localized AI is currently computed using CPU, it is not as fast as the cloud GPU AI, so you need to be patient for a while.
## If your computer's storage is not on a solid state drive, it will take a while to load.
## You can see if the AI is running by opening Windows Task Manager to see if the CPU is running at full speed.
