!! Mobile App

See [[Tiddloid|https://github.com/donmor/Tiddloid]] for Android App developed by donmor.

!! Data Privacy Protection

You can choose storage provider for your wiki workspace:

# "Github" as unlimited storage and gh-pages blogging platform.
# "Local" will create a local git repo for you, you can use [[GithubDesktop|https://github.com/desktop/desktop]] to sync manually.
# "Gitlab" and "Gitee" is on the way

!! Differences

!!! Differences from [[TiddlyDesktop|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyDesktop]]?

# NodeJS version of TiddlyWiki have seamless auto-save experience, which is taking the advantage of SyncAdaptor instead of Saver, TG have better support for NodeJS wiki
# Using NodeJS wiki, We can have separated tiddler files, which can be modified by hand, or by other programs (e.g. VSCode with [[VSCode-TW5-Syntax|https://github.com/joshuafontany/VSCode-TW5-Syntax]])
# Though TiddlyDesktop can also load wiki folder generated by nodejs-TiddlyWiki, TG can backup that folder to the Github easily
# With the Electron technology, we can use `fs`, `git` and many other nodejs things within TiddlyWiki, which greatly extend the hackability, which is the reason why I choose TiddlyWiki as my daily KM tool

!! Why Github?

Because Github is one of the best free civil level [[BaaS|https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/backend-as-a-service-baas-for-efficient-software-development_519851]]:

# Its storage is basically free, allow us to store unlimited images and PDF files, which can have permanent URIs for public download
# It has GraphQL API that allow us programmatically update our wiki
# It has free [[CI|https://github.com/features/actions]] to automatically deploy our TiddlyWiki blog
# It provides unlimited repository, public and private, which enables us to store private content into our TiddlyWiki

!! Development

!! Credits

The desktop app shell is based on [[https://github.com/atomery/singlebox|atomery/singlebox]] and [[atomery/webcatalog|https://github.com/atomery/webcatalog]], they provide lots of utils around website-generated-app, much powerful than generating app from website simply using Chrome. Also the independent developer @quanglam2807 behind these great tools helps me a lot when I develop TidGi.
